An array is a collection of items of same datatype.
At a memory level, arrays are stored in contiguous locations i.e. all the elements are stored in adjacent memory locations and in order.
We can find length of array using length method.
Eg arrName.length; returns size of array.

We can have an array of integers , array of floats , array of doubles,array of boolean , etc.

Some commonly used array operations are:

	- Traversing: This is visiting each element in the array in order.
	- Insertion: An element can be inserted into the array at a specific index.
	- Deletion: An element can be deleted from a specific index in an array.
	- Updates: Update the value at a given index.
	- Sorting: The array can be reordered based on the values.
	- Searching: Find the index of an element given a value.




CREATION and INITIALISATION OF ARRAYS 

I) One-dimemnsional Arrays 
		int arr[];		//Creation
		int[] arr;
		
		int[] arr = new int[size]   //Instantiating - creating and allocating memory to array
		
		******In Java,all arrays are dynamically allocated******
		
		int[] arr = new int[]{ 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10}; //Creating and assigning elements
		String arrStr[]={"Hello","World"};  //array of stings
		
II) Multi-dimensional Arrays
		Multidimensional arrays are arrays of arrays with each element of the array
		holding the reference of other arrays. These are also known as Jagged Arrays.
		
		int[][] arr= new int[10][30]; //a 2D array
		int[][][] intArray = new int[10][20][10]; //a 3D array
				
        int arr[][]= { { 2, 7, 9 }, { 3, 6, 1 }, { 7, 4, 2 } }; // declaring and initializing 2D array
