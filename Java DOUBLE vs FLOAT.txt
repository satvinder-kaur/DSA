In java if we try the below code we will get 
		
		float myboat = 1.2;
		float yourBoat = 10 * 2.5;
		float theBoat = Math.PI * 10;
		
		we get :- 
				error: incompatible types: possible lossy conversion from double to float
				
				
	  * This is because whenever Java encounters a decimal in a program, or a calculation generates 
		a floating point number, Java treats the number as a double by default.

So how do we declare double and float ?

	To declare a double in Java, do the following:

	-> Specify the type as double.
	-> Provide a variable name.
	-> Assign a value within the range of a double.
	-> Eg. double num = 123.456;
	
	To declare a float in Java, do the following:

	-> Specify the type as double.
	-> Provide a variable name.
	-> Assign a value within the range of a double.
	-> Append the letter f after the last number
	-> Eg. float num2 = 23.4;

Solution to the first code :

		float myboat = 1.2f;  //explicit notation
		double yourBoat = 10 * 2.5;  //change from float to double
		float theBoat = (float) (Math.PI * 10);  // explicit cast from double to float



Range of double and float 

	System.out.println(Double.MAX_VALUE);
	System.out.println(Double.MIN_VALUE);
	System.out.println(Float.MAX_VALUE);
	System.out.println(Float.MIN_VALUE);
	
	1. The upper range of a double in Java is 1.7976931348623157E308.
	2. The lower range of a double in Java is 4.9E-324.
	3. The upper range of a float in Java is 3.4028235E38.
	4. The lower range of a float in Java is 1.4E-45.
