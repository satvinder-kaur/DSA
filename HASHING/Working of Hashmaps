## How HashMaps Work Internally

1. **Quick Recap of HashMap**:
   - A `HashMap` in Java is part of the Collections framework. It allows you to store key-value pairs, where each key is mapped to a single value. Duplicate keys are not allowed.
   - For example:
     ```java
     HashMap<String, String> map = new HashMap<>();
     map.put("key", "value"); // Store a key-value pair
     String retrievedValue = map.get("key"); // Retrieve the value associated with the key "key"
     ```

2. **Under the Hood**:
   - A `HashMap` internally uses an array (often called a "bucket array") to store its key-value pairs.
   - The size of this array is determined by the initial capacity of the `HashMap`. By default, it's 16.
   - Each index position in the array can hold multiple `Node` objects. These nodes are essentially instances of `Map.Entry`, representing the key-value pairs.
   - Here's a simplified representation of a `Node`:
     ```java
     static class Node<K, V> implements Map.Entry<K, V> {
         final int hash; // Hash of the key
         final K key;
         V value;
         Node<K, V> next; // Reference to the next node (if any)
         // ...
     }
     ```
   - The generated hash of the key object is stored to avoid recalculating the hash during comparisons, which improves performance.

3. **Handling Collisions**:
   - Hashing is used to locate buckets (array indices) for keys.
   - When multiple keys produce the same hash (collision), they are stored in the same bucket using a linked list.
   - However, when entries in a single bucket reach a threshold (default value is 8), the `HashMap` converts that bucket's internal structure from a linked list to a Red-Black Tree (JEP 180).
   - This tree structure provides better performance (O(log n)) compared to the linked list (O(n)) for large buckets.
   - When the number of nodes in a bucket decreases (below a certain threshold), the tree converts back to a linked list to balance performance with memory usage.

4. **Hashing Function**:
   - Hashing assigns a unique code (hash code) to an object based on its properties.
   - A good hash function consistently produces the same hash code for equal objects.
   - In `HashMap`, the hash code determines the bucket index where a key-value pair is stored.

5. **Performance**:
   - `HashMap` provides constant-time performance for basic operations like adding or retrieving elements.
   - The trade-off is memory usage (due to linked lists or trees).

In summary, `HashMap` efficiently organizes key-value pairs using hashing and handles collisions gracefully. It's a powerful tool for building efficient data structures in Java! üòäüîëüóÑÔ∏è
